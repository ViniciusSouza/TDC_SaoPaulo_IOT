The web part of this project was hosted using a Microsoft Azure Trial Account, you can use the 150,00 USD available for a free account.
If you already have a Microsoft Azure you can use it..

In Azure you will need:

1) A Website to host the iot4dx project.

2) A MobileService using C# backend to host TDCSPMobileService project.

The website can be deployed using a the free tier, for testing propouse... But in product change it to basic, at least!
The mobile service can be deployed to the free tier with small changes to the project, the original project is using two schedule jobs to send push notification messages, and the free tier only allow one, thats why I choose the a basic tier.
